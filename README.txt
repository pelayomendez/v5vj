welovecode dic'12


##What is it?

First of all is a simple script to load and manipulate videos dynamically on a canvas element.
The original idea was to use it for developing vj web software or interactive video websites in HTML5.

Noe the project also includes v5jserver, a node.js based socket server. 
It make use of node-webkit to run as native app on Linux/Mac/Windows.
<a href='https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit'>node-webkit</a> is an app runtime based on Chromium and node.js. 
You can write native apps in HTML and Javascript with node-webkit. It also lets you to call Node.js modules directly 
from DOM and enables a new way of writing native applications with all Web technologies.

So... by running the test web app here:

.. and downloading the and running the server n your computer you´ll be able to stream the canvas content, 
(or part of it) to many diferent devices/computers on your local network. 

Please note this is a concept test release in really alpha stage.
